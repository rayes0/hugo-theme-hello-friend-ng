# Sayo Hugo Theme

My *personal* fork of the ![hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme. Check ![here](https://rayes0.github.io/) for an example of a site created using this theme.

## How to use

Clone into your Hugo folder:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rayes0/hugo-theme-sayo themes/hugo-theme-sayo
```

There is a sample `config.toml` file provided in the `exampleSite` directory, which should be enough to get started with. Additionally, check ![here](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng#more-things) for some more things you can do.

## License

As the theme borrows large portions of code from the ![hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) and ![hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) themes, it also inherits the MIT License from them. See the `LICENSE.md` file for more information.
